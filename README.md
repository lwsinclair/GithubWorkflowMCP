## Usage

The GitHub Workflow Debugger MCP is designed to be used with AI assistants that support the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides several tools that can be used to diagnose and fix GitHub Actions workflow failures.

### Required Permissions

To use this tool, you'll need a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with the following permissions:
- `repo` - Full control of private repositories
- `workflow` - Update GitHub Action workflows

You must set this token as an environment variable named `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

### Configuration

When using this tool with an MCP-compatible client, you can configure it as follows:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `<YOUR_TOKEN>` with your GitHub Personal Access Token.

### Available Tools

1. **get-failed-workflow-runs** - Fetches recent failed workflow runs for a repository
2. **get-workflow-run-jobs** - Gets jobs for a specific workflow run
3. **get-workflow-file** - Retrieves the content of a workflow file
4. **update-workflow-file** - Updates a workflow file with fixes
5. **analyze-workflow-failure** - Analyzes a failed workflow run and suggests fixes

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the GitHub Workflow Debugger MCP with an AI assistant:

1. First, get recent failed workflow runs:
   ```
   I need to check recent failed workflow runs for my repository "username/repo".
   ```

2. Analyze a specific failed run:
   ```
   Can you analyze workflow run #123456 and suggest fixes?
   ```

3. View the workflow file:
   ```
   Show me the content of the workflow file at .github/workflows/main.yml
   ```

4. Update the workflow file with fixes:
   ```
   Update the workflow file with the suggested fixes.
   ```
